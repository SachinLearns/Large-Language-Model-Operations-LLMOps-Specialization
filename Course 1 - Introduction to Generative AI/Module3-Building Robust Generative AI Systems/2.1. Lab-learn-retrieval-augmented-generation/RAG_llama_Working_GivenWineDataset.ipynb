In the 1980s the church asked David to tear out the old vines, then he watched as the land lay fallow for close to two decades. When he finally got the chance to replant, he jumped. He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines. “It took us six years before we had a crop. We could have ignored it, pulled the vines out one by one as they collapsed. But then we'd have all these different ripening patterns, which would impact consistency. It was an easy decision.”"

Chile offers its soil, its climate and its vineyards, while France contributes its winemaking savoir-faire and traditions. The result is an exceptionally elegant and complex wine.  Its launch was a major milestone in the development of Chilean wines, both in Chile itself and in the international market."

Given the limited production and high quality of this fabulous effort, its high price can not be considered unfair. It should drink well for a decade.

Swirl the glass once or twice, and you will start to uncover darker fruit notes of blackcurrant and a bare hint of pomegranate, accented with subtle notes of oak and toasted vanilla. Take a sip, and the first thing you will notice is a firm acidity that opens quickly onto dark black fruit with just a touch of anise. As your first impression fades, you will find deeply  structured tannins that fill the palate, underscoring a finish redolent with chocolate, blueberry preserves, and aged cedar. This wine evolves marvelously over the course of a glass, growing bigger and bolder as it takes in the air. The tannins unfold and show the excellent maturity of the grapes as they were brought in from the vineyard, and the fruit characters gain in intensity, building to an intricate finish that lasts for many minutes.
